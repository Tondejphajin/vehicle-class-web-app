title: "Land Vehicle Classification"
---

This project utilizes the [fastai library](https://github.com/fastai) and deep learning techniques to train a model for identifying vehicles. 

The trained model is hosted on [Huggingface](https://huggingface.co/), and a JavaScript API has been implemented to allow for user input and classification via the website. 

The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and accurate method for classifying land vehicles, with potential applications in fields such as autonomous driving and traffic management.
